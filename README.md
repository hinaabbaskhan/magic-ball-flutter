# App Challenge: Building a magic ball App
## Objective:
The goal of this challenge is to apply the knowledge learned from the Dice app in class and use it to build a magical ball app. This exercise will improve your understanding of Flutter's Stateless and Stateful widgets.


## What You will create:
You will be developing a magical 8 ball app where the ball changes at the press of a button. Refer to the attached demo video for a visual guide.

## Steps to follow:
- Download the starter project from this GitHub repository.
- Open the project in your preferred IDE(VS code or Android studio).
- Implement the Flutter Stateless and Stateful widgets to achieve the desired functionality.
- The necessary images are already added to the images folder. Use those images to change the appearance of the ball.
- Create a button that, when pressed, triggers a change in the ball's appearance.
